# Focus App

To add:
V Links for pre and post test in the collection schema
* Buttons after login that allow users to access sessions in the future
* Make sure Doubles cant be added to DB
* sign up page
* general info section
* different views for admin (who sees aprticipants) and normal users who only see their own sessions
* create a userPage for each user where the admin can see which sessions they're attending and have attended
* Add conditional logic that shows the pretest if the currenttime > starttime of the event and posttest if currenttime > 2 hours after starttime. Should prob also add links to the actual file just in case. Admin should be able to override these settings in case someone leaves early for instance
